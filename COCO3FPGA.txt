+==============================+

This is a DIY Pack for setting up EOU to work on a CoCo3FPGA board.

There are two versions:

	coco3fpga_dw_becker - This build is designed to work with a
		CoCo3FPGA DriveWire Setup.  The image for this build is in
		the build/6809_coco3fpga_dw_becker directory.  Use the
		68COCO3FPGA.VHD disk image and attach it to DriveWire drive
		0.  Type DOS to boot over DriveWire.

	 coco3fpga_sdboot_dw_becker - This build works with a CoCo3FPGA
		with the SDBoot ROM and SD Card. The image for this build is
		in the build/build/6809_coco3fpga_sdboot_dw_becker
		directory.  Write the 68COCO3FPGA.VHD file in this
		directory to a SD Card and insert it in your coco3fpga.
		Make sure that SW6 is in the UP position.  Switch the MPI
		to the slot containing your SDBoot Rom (Normally slot 2)
		and power on the CoCo3FPGA.

====

Building All the Xroar, Mame, and CoCo3FPGA Builds.

1. Edit make.sh to set the srcvhd location
2. Run make.sh

====

Building the coco3fpga_dw_becker build:

    srcvhd="/media/share1/EMU/EOU/68SDC.VHD"
    python3 ./makebootfileide.py -c "6809" -i "${srcvhd}" -e "coco3fpga" -k "coco3fpga_dw_becker"
	
Result:

		build/6809_coco3fpga_dw_becker/68COCO3FPGA.VHD

Usage:

1. Attach build/6809_coco3fpga_dw_becker/68COCO3FPGA.VHD to DriveWire Drive 0
2. Power up CoCo3FPGA
3. Type DOS

====

Building the coco3fpga_sdboot_dw_becker build:

	cpu="6809"
	srcvhd="/media/share1/EMU/EOU/68SDC.VHD"
	python3 ./makebootfileide.py -c "6809" -i "${srcvhd}" -e "coco3fpga" -k "coco3fpga_sdboot_dw_becker"
	
Result:

		build/6809_coco3fpga_sdboot_dw_becker/68COCO3FPGA.VHD

Usage:

1. Write build/6809_coco3fpga_sdboot_dw_becker/68COCO3FPGA.VHD to a SD Card
2. Insert card in CoCo3FPGA
3. Ensure SW6 is in the UP position
4. Set MPI Slot to SDBoot (Normally Slot 2)
5. Power on the CoCo3FPGA
